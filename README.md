# Email Spam Classifier

This project is an email spam classifier built using Django and machine learning techniques. The model processes email text data to classify messages as either spam or not spam. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to clean and transform text into numerical representations for machine learning classification.


## Features

- Preprocessing of email text (removal of punctuation, stopwords, and stemming)
- Conversion of text to numerical form using CountVectorizer
- Machine learning model trained using RandomForestClassifier
- Web-based interface using Django



## Tech Stack

- Python - Programming Language

- Django - Web Framework

- NumPy & Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) - Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming)

- Scikit-learn - Machine Learning (RandomForestClassifier, Train-Test Split, CountVectorizer )

- Joblib - Model Saving & Loading
